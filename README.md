This project employs the pandas and matplotlib libraries to perform a data analysis on urbanization, agriculture, CO2 emissions, arable land, and population growth across selected countries (Cuba, Argentina, Brazil, Finland, China, India) from 1965 to 2015. The code generates visualizations, including bar graphs for urban population and agricultural land, line graphs for CO2 emissions and arable land, and a pie chart illustrating the mean population growth. It offers a clear overview of trends in these indicators over the specified period for the specified countries.
